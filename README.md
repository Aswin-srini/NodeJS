**NOLAN MOVIES STATIC WEBSITE**

Tech Stack: Node.js (HTTP, FS, URL modules), HTML, JSON, Modular JS

Description:
Built a static movie information website using raw Node.js without any external frameworks. The project reads data from a JSON file and dynamically injects it into pre-defined HTML templates to serve different views. A custom-built HTTP server routes user requests to either a movie list or detailed movie page based on query parameters.

Key Highlights:

Designed a static website that serves prebuilt HTML pages enhanced with dynamic content insertion.

Used fs to read JSON and HTML files, and http and url modules to handle requests and routing.

Created custom modules to manage HTML content insertion (transferData, transfDataabt).

Implemented conditional routing to serve either a list of movies or individual movie descriptions.

Demonstrated understanding of modular code organization and core Node.js capabilities.

Outcome:
Strengthened foundational knowledge in HTTP handling, static site generation, and core Node.js modules by developing a fully functional static site without relying on frameworks.
